# Good For Poc's API

Good for PoC is creating a list of inclusive companies for people of color in tech.
It was founded by Amélie Lamont, Catt Small and Jacky Alciné. After running for a year by
ourselves, we realized we needed help. This project is now open source. Please
[view the roadmap][roadmap] to understand what kinds of contributions we are looking for.
